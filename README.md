# LinkedListLab

This project contains a custom implementation of a **singly linked list (SLL)** in C#, developed as part of a data structures lab assignment.

## Features

- Add nodes to the **beginning** or **end** of the list
- Remove nodes from the **beginning** or **end**
- Retrieve the value of a node at a specific index
- Keep track of the list size (`Count`)
- Edge case handling (empty list, invalid indices)

## Technologies

- C# (.NET 6 or later)
- xUnit for unit testing
- Visual Studio 2022+

## Test Coverage

Unit tests cover:

- Adding all 7 required names to the list
- `AddFirst()` and `AddLast()` functionality
- `RemoveFirst()` and `RemoveLast()` behavior
- `GetValue(index)` with valid/invalid inputs
- Empty list handling

## Names Used for Testing

- Joe Blow  
- Joe Schmoe  
- John Smith  
- Jane Doe  
- Bob Bobberson  
- Sam Sammerson  
- Dave Daverson

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open the `.sln` in Visual Studio  
3. Build and run the solution  
4. Use Test Explorer to run all tests
